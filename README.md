Code to simulate free-falling impactor onto dense suspensions

Used in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.033301, https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0061196, and https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.13822

I wrote this code by modifying the Hybird DEM-LBM code by Alessandro Leonardi, changed the particle interactions to 3D-DEM by Satoshi Takada, and used the neigbor list and lubrication calculation of Susp3d by Anthony Ladd.
